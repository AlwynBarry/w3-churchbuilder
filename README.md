# w3-churchbuilder
A theme for ChurchBuilder using the w3.css responsive micro-framework

* Churchbuilder is a Church Management System built by Concordant Systems Ltd (see https://www.churchbuilder.co.uk).
* The w3.css micro-framework is a small, fast, grid-based, fully responsive websites building framework.

This theme is built from the '2015' theme provided with ChurchBuilder by default.  However, it has been almost entirely changed, both to use the w3.css framework at the heart of the web pages and so bring a fully responsive theme to ChurchBuilder, and to bring entirely new page layouts.

# Technologies
Based on 2015 ChurchBuilder Theme, heavily modified to replace base CSS with w3.css

* Uses w3.css (see https://www.w3schools.com/w3css/)
* Uses a simplified variant of w3m-topnav (see https://github.com/AlwynBarry/w3m-topnav)

# Installation
1. Unzip and navigate into the w3-churchbuilder folder to reveal the w3-2015 folder
2. Using a SFTP client (like Filezilla) upload the w3-2015 folder to the base folder of your ChurchBuilder ftp site.
3. In ChurchBuilder get 'Superpowers' (if you're a CB admin you'll know what I mean!)
4. Go to Site Builder > Customisations, right click on Customisations, and choose Create
5. In the new Customisation panel (right hand side) use the Change Template button to choose w3-2015
6. In the settings that now appear, fill in as many as you need.  Minimally, set the menu to the Main Menu and add your church details.
7. In Site Builder > Sites, click on your site and in the right hand panel choose the customisation you just set up.
8. The new theme should be ready

HOWEVER, there are new page layout to choose for each page (Zone), if you wish. To do so:
1. In Site Builder > Zones, right click on the zone whose layout you want to change.
2. Select Choose Layout from the pop-up menu
3. Select the page layout you want - there are 15 page layouts to choose from!

NOTE that each page layout has different 'Customisations'. To set these customisations, on the page right-click the main document and select 'Edit customisations', and you will be presented with the different aspects of that page you can customise.  Using this you can add sliders, box-out text and much more.  For a complete live example, look at https://cambraybaptist.churchbuilder.org.uk.
